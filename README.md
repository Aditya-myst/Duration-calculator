# Duration-calculator
The Course Duration Calculator is a web application that helps users estimate the time required to complete a course based on their learning speed and study schedule.

Features
Input Fields:

Total Hours Required: Enter the total number of hours you expect to spend on the course.
Learning Speed Factor: Select your learning speed relative to an average learner (Average, Fast, Slow).
Days per Week: Number of days per week you plan to study.
Hours per Day: Number of hours per day you plan to study.
Calculation:

Upon clicking the "Calculate" button, the application calculates the total weeks required to complete the course based on the input provided.
It then converts the total weeks into years, months, and remaining weeks.
Validation:

Checks if the calculated total learning hours exceed the total hours input by the user. If so, it displays an error message indicating "Invalid input: Total duration exceeds available hours for the course."
Result Display:

Displays the estimated duration in a clear and formatted manner, including years, months, and weeks required to complete the course.
